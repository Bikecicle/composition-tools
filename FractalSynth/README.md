This is a software music tool built ground-up in Java. Built around granular synthesis techniques and polar traversals of the Mandelbrot set, this was originally designed as a means of composing my capstone piece for my Music Composition minor at NCSU (link below) which was featured in the iPearl Immersion Theater in Hunt Library. I am actively continuing development - streamlining and adding features as my needs evolve alongside experimentation with new musical ideas.

I started out with a simple console UI, but eventually moved to a simple scripting system. I plan on compiling an executable and documenting the scripting syntax down the road, but if you are interested in trying it out, you can import to Eclipse and run *main/ScriptReader.java*, or check out some of the script examples.
